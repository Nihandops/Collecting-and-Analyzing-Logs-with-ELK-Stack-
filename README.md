In this documentation, we’ll build a complete log collection and visualization pipeline using the ELK Stack — Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Filebeat.

We’ll:

Capture live Nginx logs in real time.

Send and parse them through Logstash.

Store them in Elasticsearch.

Visualize them using Kibana dashboards
